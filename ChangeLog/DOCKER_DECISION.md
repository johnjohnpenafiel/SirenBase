# Docker Decision - SirenBase Project

**Date**: October 10, 2025  
**Decision**: Do NOT use Docker for this project

---

## Context

The original planning documents suggested using Docker for local PostgreSQL development. After discussion and analysis, we determined that Docker adds unnecessary complexity for this project without providing meaningful benefits.

---

## Rationale

### Why Docker Was Initially Considered

- Team environment consistency
- Easy database setup and teardown
- Matching production environment

### Why We Chose NOT to Use Docker

1. **Solo Developer** - No team to maintain consistency with
2. **PostgreSQL Already Installed** - The harder setup work is already done
3. **Simplicity** - Reduces learning curve and focuses on core development
4. **AWS RDS in Production** - Production uses managed PostgreSQL (not Docker), so local Docker doesn't "practice" for deployment
5. **Same Outcome** - Flask connects to PostgreSQL identically whether local or Dockerized

---

## What Changed

### Development Approach

- **Before**: Docker Compose with PostgreSQL container
- **After**: Direct connection to locally installed PostgreSQL

### Benefits of This Approach

- Faster to start development (no Docker learning curve)
- One less technology to manage
- Full control over PostgreSQL configuration
- Familiar tooling and workflows (pgAdmin, Postico, psql, etc.)

---

## Implementation Details

### Local Development Setup

```bash
# Verify PostgreSQL is running
psql --version
pg_isready

# Create database
createdb sirenbase

# Configure Flask connection
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username@localhost:5432/sirenbase
```

### AWS Production Setup

```bash
# Production uses AWS RDS (managed PostgreSQL)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@your-db.rds.amazonaws.com:5432/sirenbase
```

**Note**: Flask connects to both local and RDS PostgreSQL using the same SQLAlchemy codeâ€”only the connection string changes.

## Files Updated

1. **PLANNING.md**

   - Removed Docker references from Database section
   - Updated Development Tools section (removed Docker, added database GUI tools)
   - Updated last modified date

2. **TASKS.md**

   - Changed "Install PostgreSQL or Docker" to "Verify PostgreSQL installation"
   - Updated environment setup instructions
   - Clarified database connection configuration
   - Updated last modified date

3. **CLAUDE.md**

   - Updated Key Components section
   - Modified Local Development workflow (removed docker-compose commands)

4. **DOCKER_DECISION.md** (this file)
   - Created to document the decision and rationale

---

## Future Considerations

Docker could be reconsidered if:

- Multiple developers join the team
- Need to test multiple PostgreSQL versions
- Deployment strategy changes to containerized services (ECS/Fargate)

For the current MVP scope with a solo developer, local PostgreSQL is the optimal choice.

---

## Action Items

- [x] Update PLANNING.md to remove Docker references
- [x] Update TASKS.md to reflect local PostgreSQL setup
- [x] Update CLAUDE.md with new development workflow
- [x] Document decision in DOCKER_DECISION.md
- [ ] Verify PostgreSQL installation and connectivity
- [ ] Create `sirenbase` database
- [ ] Configure `.env` with correct PostgreSQL credentials

---

**Conclusion**: By removing Docker from the project, we've simplified the development setup while maintaining all necessary functionality. This allows focus on building the core application features without the overhead of learning and managing containerization.
