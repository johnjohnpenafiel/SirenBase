### NOTES FOR UI AND FUNCTIONS IMPROVEMENT

## 📊 DASHBOARD

## 🗄️ INVENTORY TRACKING

### PRE-SELECTED CATEGORY (UI)

When in the item detail page:

- Dashboard → Inventory Tool Module → Category Items View → Item Detail Page

The ADD button should automatically open the item addition modale with the pre-selected current category page.
For example, I click on category "Syrups" and I'm routed to Syrups Item detail page then if I click on ADD item the modale that opens to add an item asks for name input and category selection, the selection should be already syrups, because most likely the user will add that kind of item.

### ITEM NAMING CONVENTION (INCONSISTENCY)

The real problem is when users intend to add an item to the same group (for example, "Caramel Sauce") but enter a slightly different name (like just "Caramel" or "Caramel Sauces"). Even though it's fine to have multiple items with the same name since each has a unique code, this naming inconsistency results in items that should be grouped together showing up as separate items or groups in the system. This leads to fragmentation: similar items that are actually the same get split up just because of small differences in how their names are entered.

### MOBILE ICON IMPROVEMENTS

When in mobile view hide name for buttons and just show icons, where it make sense for better space usage.
For example:
instead of [(Delete Icon) Delete] just [(Delete Icon)]
instead of [(History Icon) History] just [(History Icon)]
instead of [(Back to Inventory Icon) Back to Inventory] just [(Back to Inventory Icon)]

### HEADER/NAVBAR

This section needs work, mainly it needs spacing and removing unnecessary user naming at least on mobile view. Keep icon.
Logout button could be from a drop down when clicking on the profile icon on the header to save more space.
Profile icon could have more functionality in the future.
