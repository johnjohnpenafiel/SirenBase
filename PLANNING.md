# SirenBase - Multi-Tool Planning Document

## Project Overview

**SirenBase** is a comprehensive digital operations platform designed for Starbucks store partners. It provides a unified suite of specialized tools to streamline daily workflows, replacing manual paper-based systems with fast, mobile-friendly, and accountable digital solutions. Partners log in once and access multiple tools from a central dashboard, each designed to solve a specific operational challenge.

---

## High-Level Direction

### Vision Statement

Create a **single, unified operations platform** that:

- Consolidates multiple store operation tools into one app
- Eliminates paper-based tracking systems across different workflows
- Provides real-time visibility into inventory, counts, and restocking needs
- Maintains complete accountability through comprehensive audit logging
- Delivers a consistent, intuitive user experience across all tools
- Empowers partners to work faster and smarter with mobile-first design

### Multi-Tool Architecture

SirenBase follows a **"hub and spoke" model**:

```
Login → Dashboard (Tool Grid) → Select Tool → Tool-Specific Workflows
                ↓
          Admin Panel (admins only)
```

**Dashboard Concept**:

- Grid of tool cards (e.g., "Tracking System", "Milk Count", "RTD&E")
- Each card routes to a dedicated tool with its own workflows
- Admin Panel card appears only for users with admin role
- Simple, fast navigation - partners can switch between tools instantly

**Tool Independence**:

- Each tool operates independently with its own UI and data
- Tools can be built, tested, and deployed incrementally
- New tools can be added without affecting existing ones
- Shared infrastructure (auth, components, design system) reduces development time

---

```

### Key Interactions

1. **Authentication Flow (Shared)**

   - User enters partner number + PIN
   - Frontend sends to `/api/auth/login`
   - Backend validates, returns JWT token
   - Token stored in localStorage
   - Token included in all subsequent requests

2. **Dashboard Flow**

   - User logs in → Redirected to `/dashboard`
   - Dashboard displays tool cards (Tracking, Milk Count, RTD&E)
   - Admin users also see "Admin Panel" card
   - User clicks card → Routes to `/tools/{tool-name}/`

3. **Tool Operations Flow**

   - User performs action within a tool
   - Frontend sends authenticated request to `/api/{tool-name}/*`
   - Backend validates JWT, processes request
   - Database updated, audit log created (if applicable)
   - Response sent to frontend
   - UI updates to reflect changes

4. **Admin Operations Flow**
   - Admin user clicks "Admin Panel" card
   - Routes to `/admin` (protected route)
   - Manages users across entire platform
   - Uses `/api/auth/admin/*` endpoints

---

## Key Architectural Decisions

### Decision 1: API Namespacing Strategy ✅

**Choice**: Namespaced routes per tool

**Rationale**:

- Clear separation between tools (`/api/tracking/items` vs `/api/milk-count/sessions`)
- Prevents naming conflicts as more tools are added
- Easier to understand which tool an endpoint belongs to
- Matches frontend routing structure (`/tools/tracking/*`)

**Implementation**:

```
/api/auth/*                 # Shared authentication
/api/tracking/*             # Tool 1: Inventory Tracking
/api/milk-count/*           # Tool 2: Milk Count
/api/rtde/*                 # Tool 3: RTD&E
```

### Decision 2: Admin Role Strategy ✅

**Choice**: Global admin role

**Rationale**:

- Single store, same staff use all tools
- Admins should have full platform access (user management, tool-specific admin features)
- Simpler to implement and understand for MVP
- Can add granular per-tool permissions later if needed

**Implementation**:

- `users.role` column: `'admin'` or `'staff'`
- Admin Panel appears as dashboard card (visible only to admins)
- Admin panel manages users globally
- Tool-specific admin features (e.g., par levels) use same admin role check

### Decision 3: Database Table Naming ✅

**Choice**: Prefixed table names in single schema

**Rationale**:

- Simpler to work with (no schema switching)
- Standard PostgreSQL practice for multi-module apps
- Easier migrations and backups
- All tables visible in one place for debugging

**Implementation**:

```sql
-- Shared
users

-- Tool 1: Tracking
tracking_items
tracking_history

-- Tool 2: Milk Count
milk_count_sessions
milk_count_par_levels
milk_count_milk_types

-- Tool 3: RTD&E
rtde_items
rtde_pull_lists
```

---

## Database Strategy

### Shared Tables

**users** - Single user table for entire platform

- id (UUID, primary key)
- partner_number (String, unique, not null)
- name (String, not null)
- pin_hash (String, not null)
- role (Enum: 'admin', 'staff')
- created_at (Timestamp)
- updated_at (Timestamp)

### Tool-Specific Tables

Each tool has its own prefixed tables. See individual tool planning docs:

- **Tracking Tool**: `Planning/InventoryTracking.md` (tracking_items, tracking_history)
- **Milk Count Tool**: `Planning/MilkCount.md` (milk_count_sessions, milk_count_par_levels, etc.)
- **RTD&E Tool**: `Planning/RTDE.md` (rtde_items, rtde_pull_lists, etc.)

### Key Database Principles

- UUIDs for primary keys (prevents enumeration attacks)
- Timestamps on all tables for auditing
- Foreign key constraints with appropriate cascade rules
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Soft deletes where appropriate (preserve audit trail)

---

## Shared vs. Tool-Specific Components

### Shared Frontend Components

Located in `frontend/src/components/shared/`:

- **Layout Components**: Dashboard, NavBar, Footer
- **UI Primitives**: Button, Input, Card, Dialog (ShadCN)
- **Counter Component**: +/- buttons (used by Milk Count and RTD&E)
- **Auth Components**: LoginForm, ProtectedRoute
- **Utility Components**: LoadingSpinner, ErrorMessage, Toast

### Tool-Specific Frontend Components

Located in `frontend/src/components/tools/{tool-name}/`:

- Each tool has its own component directory
- Tool-specific forms, displays, and logic
- Reuses shared components for consistency

### Shared Backend Utilities

Located in `backend/app/`:

- **Auth Middleware**: JWT validation, admin_required decorator
- **Error Handlers**: Consistent error responses
- **Utilities**: Password hashing, validation helpers

### Tool-Specific Backend Modules

Located in `backend/app/tools/{tool_name}/`:

- Models, routes, schemas, and utilities per tool
- Isolated from other tools (no cross-tool dependencies)

---

## Security Considerations

### Authentication & Authorization

- PINs hashed with bcrypt (NEVER store plaintext)
- JWT tokens with 24-hour expiration
- Secure HTTP-only cookies (future enhancement)
- Role-based access: global `admin` and `staff` roles
- All endpoints require valid JWT token (except login/signup)

### Data Protection

- Partner numbers treated as sensitive PII
- HTTPS enforced in production
- Environment variables for all secrets (NEVER commit to Git)
- Regular security updates for dependencies
- Input validation on both client and server

### API Security

- All validation happens server-side
- Rate limiting on sensitive endpoints (login, future)
- CORS properly configured for frontend origin
- SQL injection prevention via SQLAlchemy ORM
- XSS protection via output sanitization

---

## Assumptions

1. **Single Store Deployment** - MVP designed for one Starbucks location
2. **Limited Concurrent Users** - Typically 5-10 staff members max at once
3. **Internet Available** - Store has reliable wifi/cellular connectivity
4. **Mobile Devices** - Staff have smartphones or tablets available
5. **Shared User Accounts** - Same login works for all tools
6. **Admin Pre-Exists** - At least one admin user seeded manually
7. **Tool Independence** - Tools don't need to share data (except user accounts)

---

## Constraints

### Technical Constraints

- Must work on mobile browsers (iOS Safari, Android Chrome)
- Must be responsive down to 320px width
- Must work with intermittent connectivity (graceful degradation)
- Must not expose partner numbers to unauthorized users
- Each tool must function independently

### Business Constraints

- Budget-conscious (free tier services preferred for MVP)
- Fast time-to-market (target 4-6 weeks per tool)
- Minimal training required (staff should understand in < 5 minutes)
- Must complement (not replace) official Starbucks recordkeeping

### Development Constraints

- Solo developer initially (code must be maintainable by one person)
- Limited time for learning new technologies (stick to known stack)
- Must be deployable without complex infrastructure
- Build tools incrementally (can't wait for all three to deploy)

---

## Risk Assessment

### Technical Risks

1. **Database Concurrency** - Multiple staff updating simultaneously
   - _Mitigation_: PostgreSQL transactions, proper locking
2. **Session Management** - JWT token expiration during active use
   - _Mitigation_: 24-hour expiration, refresh token strategy (future)
3. **Mobile Performance** - Slow loading on cellular networks
   - _Mitigation_: Code splitting, lazy loading, optimization

### Operational Risks

1. **Data Loss** - Critical inventory/count data could be lost
   - _Mitigation_: Automated daily backups, point-in-time recovery
2. **Downtime** - System unavailable when staff needs it
   - _Mitigation_: Health checks, monitoring, fallback to paper temporarily
3. **User Error** - Staff might make mistakes (wrong counts, wrong items)
   - _Mitigation_: Confirmation prompts, clear UI, audit trail for corrections

---

## Success Metrics

### User Adoption

- 90%+ of daily operations use SirenBase tools (not paper)
- All staff trained and comfortable with platform within 2 weeks
- Zero paper logs after 1 month of tool deployment
- Positive partner feedback (survey or informal)

### Technical Performance

- 99%+ uptime during business hours (6 AM - 10 PM)
