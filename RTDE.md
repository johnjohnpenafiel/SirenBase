# RTD&E Counting System

## Overview

The RTD&E Counting System is a streamlined digital tool designed to simplify and speed up the process of restocking the Ready-to-Drink & Eat (RTD&E) display at Starbucks. This display includes chilled items like sandwiches, yogurts, cheeses, bottled drinks, and waters, as well as room-temperature items such as chips and sauces.

## The Problem

Currently, partners rely on the Siren's Eye visual guide to determine how the display should look and what items are missing. This process involves repeatedly comparing the display to the guide, walking back and forth between the display and the back of house (BOH), and often forgetting or miscounting items. Some partners take pictures or notes to work faster, but this still slows them down and causes inefficiencies—such as the iPad locking, needing to zoom in on photos, or bringing incorrect quantities.

## The Solution

The RTD&E Counting System integrates directly into the SirenBase app and introduces a quick, digital way to count, restock, and track RTD&E items. The tool presents a live list of all items that should be in the display, allowing partners to efficiently log counts and generate pull lists.

## How It Works

### 1. Log In & Start Counting
Partners open SirenBase, select the RTD&E Tool, and view a full item list for the display.

### 2. Add or Subtract Quantities
Each item starts at "0," with simple "+" and "–" buttons for quick adjustments. For bulk items like waters, partners can directly type the number instead.

### 3. Generate Pull List
After entering counts, the tool automatically calculates what's missing and generates a pull list.

### 4. Back of House Fulfillment
In the BOH area, partners can view the pull list with each item and quantity needed. Each item includes a "Pull" button to mark it as taken.

### 5. Restock the Display
With all items gathered, partners can use the Siren's Eye for placement, saving time by knowing exactly what and how many items to bring.

## Admin Functionality

Admins can update item lists and counts seasonally or as RTD&E offerings change, ensuring that all stores stay in sync with the current menu and planograms.

## Key Benefits

- Reduces time wasted walking between display and BOH
- Eliminates guesswork and forgotten items
- Ensures consistent restocks aligned with the Siren's Eye guide
- Adapts dynamically to seasonal or product changes
